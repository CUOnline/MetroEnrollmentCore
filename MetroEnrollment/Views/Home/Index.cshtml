    <p>This tool accepts a list of data and uses it to enroll MSU students in CU Canvas courses.</p>

    <p>
        It will check if the user already exists by searching for the specified email as well as SIS IDs and unique names matching the specified id (with the prefix "metro_" ). If no user is found, a new one will be created.
        The user will be enrolled in the specified course section, as long as the provided course data unambigiously identifies a unique course. If multiple sections exist have the same name and the same enrollment term, this ambiguity needs to be resolved before the enrollment will succeed.
        Upon completion, you will receive an email with a copy of the input data along with any errors or status messages for each record.
        The data should be in CSV format with the following headers/fields (any order, case-insensitive).
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>first name</li>
        <li> last name</li>
        <li> email</li>
        <li> id (The ID of the student in the Metro system)</li>
        <li> course code (e.g. PHY, MATH)</li>
        <li> course number (e.g. 101, 201)</li>
        <li> section number (e.g. 001 [Leading zeroes must match what appears in Canvas])</li>
    </ul>
